# üëã Hi, I'm Robin Kumar

https://beta.hometriangle.com/dashboard/payments/order/416d1d5d-8a08-4867-a704-4c93a7e7da30


I am a professional **Full Stack Developer** with experience in both front-end and back-end technologies. Throughout my career, I have contributed to various projects across different domains, focusing on delivering scalable and user-friendly applications.

I have had the opportunity to work on the **back-end** of several projects, building robust and efficient systems, as well as **front-end** development, creating intuitive and responsive interfaces. Alongside my professional work, I have also worked on multiple **personal projects**, exploring new technologies and continually expanding my skill set.

In addition to my development work, I am also passionate about improving my coding skills and ranking on **LeetCode**. I am currently ranked in the **Top ~70K globally** on LeetCode, constantly pushing myself to solve more challenging problems and improve my algorithms and data structures knowledge.

I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations, eager to contribute my expertise and continue learning and growing in the world of software development.

While these are the languages I've actively worked with, I've also explored a variety of other languages and technologies. However, I believe that in programming, **logic and problem-solving skills** are more important than the specific language you use. The ability to think critically and approach challenges with a structured, efficient solution is what truly defines a skilled developer.
